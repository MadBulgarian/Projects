###### This is a very simple WordPress Theme

# Simple and Basic
Starting with the header area, it contains the Website's Name and Slogan followed by a navigation menu strip. The main area contains the blog with all the posts. Clicking either the heading or the button of any post will take the viewer to the post page where they can read the whole post. Each post displays its author and the time it was publised. In the single post page, users can write commenta which will be displayed afterwards under the post text. Normal pages are pretty simple, containing main content including heading and text. Every page includes a sidebar on the right side which contains dynamic WordPress widgets.
